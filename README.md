## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png
)

This project was built to locate events happening around the USA. There is a filter option to find vibes near you. This app is a progressive web app with the ability to work offline and a serverless backend developed using a TDD technique. Users of this app will be able to access it whenever they want to view upcoming events for a specific city.

![VibeVenture Serverless Architectural Diagram Image](diagram.png)

VibeVenture was written in React and Javascript for the front-end component and is hosted on GitHub Pages. The backend was written using a combination of React, Javascript, Node.js, and Express (with Lambda Functions) and is hosted on Amazon Web Services. 
  
 **User Stories:** 
1. As a user, I would like to be able to filter events by city so that I can see the list of events that take place in that city. 
2. As a user, I would like to be able to show/hide event details so that I can see more/less information about an event. 
3. As a user, I would like to be able to specify the number of events I want to view in the app so that I can see more or fewer events in the events list at once. 
4. As a user, I would like to be able to use the app when offline so that I can see the events I viewed the last time I was online.
5. As a user, I would like to be able to add the app shortcut to my home screen so that I can open the app faster. 
6. As a user, I would like to be able to see a chart showing the upcoming events in each city so that I know what events are organized in which city.

<p>Scenario 1: When user hasn't searched for a city, show upcoming events from all cities.
* Given user hasn’t searched for any city;
* When the user opens the app;
* Then the user should see a list of upcoming events.

Scenario 2: User should see a list of suggestions when they search for a city.
* Given that the main page is open;
* When user starts typing in the city textbox;
* Then the user should receive a list of cities (suggestions) that match what they've typed.

Scenario 3: User can select a city from the suggested list.
* Given user was typing “Chicago” in the city textbox AND the list of suggested cities is showing;
* When the user selects a city (e.g. “Chicago, Illinois”) from the list;
* Then their city should be changed to that city(i.e., “Chicago, Il”) AND the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.</p>

* Given that the main page is open;
* When a user opens the app;
* Then 32 events will be shown by default.
  
Scenario 2: User can change the number of events displayed. 
* Given that a specific city event results are showing;
* When a user clicks submit on the search bar to filter for a specific city;
* Then an optional setting will show up below to specify the number of events to display.
